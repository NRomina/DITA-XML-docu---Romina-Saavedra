        <p class="p">Spotify is a digital music streaming service. It gives you instant access to its vast
            online library of music and podcasts, allowing you to listen to any content of your
            choice at any time. It is both legal and easy to use.</p>
        <p class="p">You will find millions of songs from a variety of genres and artists, from obscure indie
            rock and top 40 pop to movie soundtracks and classical music. It also has a complex
            algorithm to recommend music based on your listening history, as well as curated
            playlists and internet radio stations.</p>
